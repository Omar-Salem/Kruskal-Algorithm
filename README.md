Kruskal-Algorithm
======================================

According to Wikipedia:"Kruskal's algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connectedweighted graph.
This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.
If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).
Kruskal's algorithm is an example of a greedy algorithm.

In short, Kruskal's algorithm is used to connect all nodes in a graph, using the least cost possible.
